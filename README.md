Rails Learned Today

This is a journal for interesting rails facts learned by me, parked on heroku! Currently under development!!!

Using this is pretty simple! In order for a "fact" to appear in the web page, just create a text file within the "facts/txt" folder. 
You can even use html in your text files!

Have fun :)
